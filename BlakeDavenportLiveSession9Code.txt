##Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend? 

```{r}
data("ukcars")
plot(ukcars)
```

##Yes. There is a definate pattern to the sinewave, and a growth trend over time (which closely mirrors the economic growth for that time).

##Use a classical decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. 

```{r}
fitd <- decompose(ukcars)
plot(fitd)
```

##Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part (a)? 

##Yes. The basic trend is still present 

##Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data. 

```{r}
ukcarsadj <- seasadj(fitd)
plot(ukcarsadj)
```
##Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier? 

```{r}
ukcarsv1<-ts(c(ukcars[1:54],ukcars[55]+200,ukcars, ukcars[56:191]), start=c(1977,1), frequency=12)
fitd1 <- decompose(ukcarsv1)
ukcarsadj1 <- seasadj(fitd1)
plot(fitd1)
```
##Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series? 

```{r}
ukcarsv2<-ts(c(ukcars[1:100],ukcars[101]+200,ukcars, ukcars[102:191]), start=c(1977,1), frequency=12)
fitd2 <- decompose(ukcarsv2)
ukcarsadj2 <- seasadj(fitd2)
plot(fitd2)
```
##It flattened the curve near the outlier, but it does not functionaly change the trend

##Now use STL to decompose the series. Does the outlier have the same effect with STL?

```{r}
fit <- stl(ukcars, s.window=5)
plot(fit)
plot(ukcars, col="gray",
  main="Year",
  ylab="Cars Sold", xlab="")
lines(fit$time.series[,2],col="red",ylab="Trend")
```
##There is still a similar trend
